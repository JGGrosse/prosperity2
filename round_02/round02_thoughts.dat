        ORCHIDS:

        - Humidity & Sunlight influence production:
            - Sunlight:
                - Whenever exposure is less than 7 hours a day, production will decrease with 4% for every 10 minutes (10 minutes?  -->  10 timesteps??)
            - Humidity:
                - Ideal between 60 - 80 %
                - Outside those limits production will fall with 2% for every 5% point of Humidity change
        
        - Storage:
            - 0.1 Seashell per Orchid per timestep
        
        - Tariffs & Fees:
